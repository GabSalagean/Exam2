//1-import from java; Array list;
//2-get values
//3-if temperature greater than 37.5
    //then system.out.println("fever");
//if temperature less than 37.5
    //then system.out.println ("no fever");
//4-open codepad
//5-view highest temp

//*#26
//after getting the values, I would still print out the temperatures on the code pad. but after that, I would
//use the Collections.max in the temperature values instead of the loop.

//*#27
//After I would call the Array list, I would use the sort method & create a temperature object too. In the temp code, I would
//call the array list & use the sort in there. There would not be a loop in this method neither
//since there is no return value
